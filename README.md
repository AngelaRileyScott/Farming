FARM CALCULATOR:

This program was designed for the farmers at Riley Ridge Farms to be a tool to calculate the costs of a sale. It also provides a total for how much each farmer takes home as take-home pay.

A window will open to request data from the user. It will ask for first name, last name, and an ID number. The farm owner will need to assign a unique identification number to each picker on the farm.

The second section of the GUI will ask for the berry or produce type. There are three options: blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries. It also allows the user to calculate the gallons and quarts of each item picked. It will then report the price that it owed to the farmer and the amount of the farmer’s take-home pay.

The last section will ask about the produce quality. The picker can choose to define the berries as EXCELLENT, GREAT, GOOD, or FARMER/JAM QUALITY.  This will calculate any discounts on the produce being sold.

The program has three buttons.
1.	Calculates the information from the form in the program. It reports the farmers’ name, their reported picked totals, and the selected quality of produce.
2.	Reports the current prices of the farm without discounts.
3.	Exit the program.

The program also has a menu bar that provides additional information for the farmers. This includes the farm hours, the prices available for produce, and the email to the farm owner.
